  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="b">Physical Network</td>
    <td>Consists of the cables (coaxial cable, twisted pair, fiber optic, and telephone lines) that connect the different hardware residing on the network,
	the adapter used on computers connected to the network (hosts), and any concentrators, repeaters, routers, or bridges used in the network.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="b">Logical Network</td>
    <td>Is a portion of a physical network that connects two or more
	logical network interfaces or devices. A logical network interface or device is the software entity that is known by an operating system.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="b">Transistor</td>
    <td>Is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch electronic signals and electrical power.
	Transistors are one of the basic building blocks of modern electronics.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="b">Integrated circuit</td>
    <td>An IC is a collection of electronic components resistors, transistors, capacitors.
	All stuffed into a tiny chip, and connected together to achieve a common goal.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="b">Resistor</td>
    <td>Resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines, among other uses.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="b">Capacitor</td>
    <td>Is a device that stores electric charge in an electric field. It is a passive electronic component with two terminals.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td class="b">Printed circuit board</td>
    <td>A printed circuit board, or PCB, is used to mechanically support and electrically connect electronic components using conductive pathways,
	tracks or signal traces etched from copper sheets laminated onto a non-conductive substrate..</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="b">Microprocessor</td>
    <td>Is an electronic component that is used by a computer to do its work. It is a central processing unit on a single integrated circuit chip containing millions of very small components including transistors, 
	resistors, and diodes that work together.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="b">Bus</td>
    <td>A bus network is a network topology in which nodes are directly connected to a common half-duplex link called a bus.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td class="b">FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Interface)</td>
    <td>Fiber Distributed Data Interface is a standard for data transmission in a local area network. FDDI has dual primary and secondary communication rings. The primary ring works alongside the network, and
	the secondary ring remains idle and available for backup.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="b">Ethernet</td>
    <td>Is the traditional technology for connecting devices in a wired local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN), 
	enabling them to communicate with each other via a protocol. A set of rules or common network language.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="b">Twisted-pair</td>
    <td>Twisted pair cabling is a type of wiring in which two conductors of a single circuit are twisted together
	for the purposes of improving electromagnetic compatibility.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="b">Coaxial</td>
    <td>Coaxial cable is a type of cable that has an inner conductor surrounded by an insulating layer, surrounded by a conductive shielding.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td class="b">Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI)</td>
    <td>The PCI bus supports the functions found on a processor bus but in a standardized format that is independent of any given processor's native bus.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="b">Industry Standard Architecture bus (ISA)</td>
    <td>Is a computer bus that allows additional expansion cards to be connected to a computer's motherboard. It is a standard bus architecture for IBM compatibles.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="b">TCP/IP</td>
    <td>Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. 
	TCP/IP can also be used as a communications protocol in a private computer network (an intranet or extranet).</td>
